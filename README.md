## Usage/Examples

```python
try:
    stt = STT(model_size="base.en", device="cuda", compute_type="float16", language="en", logging_level="INFO")
    stt.listen() # Start listening in background

    while stt.is_listening:
        last_transcription = stt.get_last_transcription()
        if len(last_transcription) > 0:
            print("You said: ", last_transcription) # Get last transcription
            # If user said 'stop' then stop the transcription process by calling stt.stop()
            if "stop" in last_transcription.lower():
                stt.stop()

        time.sleep(1)
